Balance Sheet Structure and Calculations:

1. Assets
   A. Current Assets:
      - Cash: $134,000.00
      - Accounts Receivable: $105,000.00
      - Inventory: $293,000.00
      Total Current Assets: $532,000.00

   B. Fixed Assets:
      - Net Fixed Assets (PPE): $1,730,000.00
      Total Fixed Assets: $1,730,000.00

   Total Assets: $2,262,000.00

2. Liabilities & Stockholders' Equity
   A. Current Liabilities:
      - Accounts Payable: $210,000.00
      - Notes Payable: $160,000.00
      Total Current Liabilities: $370,000.00

   B. Long-term Liabilities:
      - Long-term Debt: $845,000.00
      Total Long-term Liabilities: $845,000.00

   C. Stockholders' Equity:
      - Common Stock: $500,000.00
      - Retained Earnings: $547,000.00
      Total Stockholders' Equity: $1,047,000.00

   Total Liabilities & Equity: $2,262,000.00

Key Financial Metrics:

1. Net Working Capital (NWC):
   Calculation: Current Assets - Current Liabilities
   $532,000.00 - $370,000.00 = $162,000.00

2. Debt to Equity Ratio (D/E):
   Calculation: Total Liabilities / Total Equity
   $1,215,000.00 / $1,047,000.00 = 1.16

Verification:
1. Balance Sheet Balances:
   Total Assets = Total Liabilities + Total Equity
   $2,262,000.00 = $2,262,000.00

2. Retained Earnings Calculation:
   Total Assets - (Total Liabilities + Common Stock)
   $2,262,000.00 - ($1,215,000.00 + $500,000.00)
   = $547,000.00
