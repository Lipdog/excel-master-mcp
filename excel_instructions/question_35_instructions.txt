Balance Sheet Structure and Calculations:

1. Assets
   A. Current Assets:
      - Cash: $125,000.00
      - Accounts Receivable: $105,000.00
      - Inventory: $290,000.00
      Total Current Assets: $520,000.00

   B. Fixed Assets:
      - Net Fixed Assets (PPE): $1,750,000.00
      Total Fixed Assets: $1,750,000.00

   Total Assets: $2,270,000.00

2. Liabilities & Stockholders' Equity
   A. Current Liabilities:
      - Accounts Payable: $200,000.00
      - Notes Payable: $160,000.00
      Total Current Liabilities: $360,000.00

   B. Long-term Liabilities:
      - Long-term Debt: $0.00
      Total Long-term Liabilities: $0.00

   C. Stockholders' Equity:
      - Common Stock: $400,000.00
      - Retained Earnings: $1,510,000.00
      Total Stockholders' Equity: $1,910,000.00

   Total Liabilities & Equity: $2,270,000.00

Key Financial Metrics:

1. Net Working Capital (NWC):
   Calculation: Current Assets - Current Liabilities
   $520,000.00 - $360,000.00 = $160,000.00

2. Debt to Equity Ratio (D/E):
   Calculation: Total Liabilities / Total Equity
   $360,000.00 / $1,910,000.00 = 0.19

Verification:
1. Balance Sheet Balances:
   Total Assets = Total Liabilities + Total Equity
   $2,270,000.00 = $2,270,000.00

2. Retained Earnings Calculation:
   Total Assets - (Total Liabilities + Common Stock)
   $2,270,000.00 - ($360,000.00 + $400,000.00)
   = $1,510,000.00
